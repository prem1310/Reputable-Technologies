## üß© System Architecture & Data Flows

This is a **static frontend web suite**. No server/database is included. All forms simulate submission (some store in `localStorage` for demo).

### **Component Interaction Diagram**

```mermaid
graph TD
A["User"] --clicks--> B["Navigation/Menu"]
A --interacts--> C["Slider/Carousel"]
A --opens--> D["Modal/Popup"]
A --submits--> E["Form"]
E --validates--> F["main.js Validation Logic"]
E --(simulates)--> G["Browser Storage / Success Message"]
A --scrolls--> H["Animated Cards/Logos"]
B --navigates--> I["Page Sections"]
```

### **Form Submission (No Backend)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Form
    participant JS as main.js
    participant L as localStorage (sometimes)
    U->>F: Fill form fields
    F->>JS: onSubmit event
    JS->>JS: Validate fields (regex, required)
    alt Valid
        JS->>L: (Optional) Store or log data
        JS->>F: Show Success Message
    else Invalid
        JS->>F: Show Error Message
    end
```

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility & Responsiveness

- All interactive elements have `:focus` styles and ARIA labels.
- Keyboard navigation for tabs, sliders, popups.
- Color contrasts, font sizes, and spacing meet accessibility best practices.
- All modals trap focus and close on ESC.
- Animations respect "prefers-reduced-motion".
- Responsive design (CSS grid/flex, adaptive paddings, font scaling).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing & Debugging

- **Debugging utilities**: Some forms (e.g., `about.html` inquiry) expose `getAllSubmissions()` and `clearAllSubmissions()` globally in browser console for demo/testing.
- **Adding new products/cases**: Duplicate card blocks and update icons/text. For forms, extend validation patterns if needed.
- **Styling**: Modular CSS; add new classes following existing patterns for effects/transitions.
- **JS**: Use unobtrusive event listeners; avoid inline JS except for page-specific logic.
